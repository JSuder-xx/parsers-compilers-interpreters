# parsers-compilers-interpreters
Personal submissions of parsers, compilers, and interpreters to an on-line coding practice and competition website (which shall remain nameless to keep this from appearing in search and ruining other peoples fun).

The "infer" example features a Damas-Hindley-Milner type inferencing algorithm which was incredibly fun to implement.

This repository may be of use to other developers who program in OCaml / F# / Elm and are half-smart. I am only half smart. I need to write code with descriptive and contextualized / concretized names otherwise I cannot keep anything straight. When studying type theory and Haskell code one very often encounters single letter names which are entirely appropriate to that audience. I am not being facetious: They are just smart and I respect their right and desire to code in that fashion. However, I find that style of coding makes certain concepts impenetrable to working engineers which ought to be accessible.
